I assume that the application is built using the Javascript language. It is being built for the team of 6 people, so one could say that the use of Jenkins in this case would be too much work. However, if the application being developed requiers custom hardware/environment then the highly flexible nature of Jenkins would prove to better. I assume that the application being build is something more or less standard: lets say it is a CRUD for the shipping company to track their shipments, enable messaging to clients and so on. 
Firstly we would want to build the environment of choice: ubuntu or windows,setup the node environment, download the dependencies and test the code being pushed against the existing tests and lint it in accordance with our styleguide.GitHub Actions has a tool named SuperLinter that can be used for linting just about every language. We can easily setup the node environment by clicking 'setup node environment' in the GitHub Marketplace. We then would need to test the code being pr'ed by running tests in the node environment we set up previously.
 As for alternatives for the GitHub Actions and Jenkins there are plenty. Travis CI, AppVeyor, Circle CI and Cyclic just to name some.
